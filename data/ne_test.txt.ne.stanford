US	LOCATION
automaker

deal
fails
to
pass
Senate	ORGANIZATION

December
12
,
2008

A
US	LOCATION
$
14
billion
bailout
package
deal
for
the
``
Big
Three
``
United States	LOCATION
automakers
--
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
,
and
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
--
has
been
rejected
in
the
United States	LOCATION
Senate	ORGANIZATION
after
failing
a
procedural
vote
.

The
bill
was
rejected
after
bipartisan
discussions
on
the
bailout
broke
down
when
Republican Party	ORGANIZATION
leaders
insisted
that
the
United Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
(
UAW	ORGANIZATION
)
union
agree
to
increase
wage
cuts
by
next
year
in
order
to
bring
their
pay
into
line
with
those
of
Japanese
automobile
companies
in
the
United States	LOCATION
.

The
UAW	ORGANIZATION
refused
to
meet
the
demands
.

The
final
vote
count
in
the
Senate	ORGANIZATION
was
52-35
,
eight
short
of
the
60
needed
to
pass
.

Only
ten
Republicans
joined
forty
Democrats
and
two
independents
in
voting
for
the
bill
.

Three
Democrats
voted
with
thirty-one
Republicans
against
it
.

Senate	ORGANIZATION
Majority
leader
Harry Reid	PERSON
said
that
he
was
``
terribly
disappointed
``
by
the
failure
of
the
bill
to
pass
.

``
I
dread
looking
at
Wall
Street
tomorrow
.

It
's
not
going
to
be
a
pleasant
sight
,
``
Reid	PERSON
said
.

``
Millions
of
Americans
,
not
only
the
auto
workers
but
people
who
sell
cars
,
car
dealerships
,
people
who
work
on
cars
are
going
to
be
directly
impacted
and
affected
.
``

Republican
Senator
Bob Corker	PERSON
was
also
unhappy
about
the
rejection
.

``
We
were
about
three
words
away
from
a
deal
.

We
solved
everything
substantively
and
about
three
words
keep
us
from
reaching
a
conclusion
,
``
he
said
.

Some
Democrats
now
want
U.S.	LOCATION
President
Bush	PERSON
to
reserve
a
portion
of
the
$
700
billion
bailout
package
earmarked
for
Wall
Street
to
assist
the
flagging
car
industry
.

Stock
markets
worldwide
fell
dramatically
on
the

White House	ORGANIZATION
considering
auto
rescue
plan

December
13
,
2008

After
a
plan
to
bail
out
three
large
American
auto
companies
failed
to
pass
the
Senate	ORGANIZATION
this
week
,
the
White House	ORGANIZATION
has
said
that
it
is
considering
using
some
of
the
US	LOCATION
$
700
billion
earmarked
to
rescue
the
banking
industry
to
bail
out
the
automakers
.

The
White House	ORGANIZATION
says
that
the
collapse
of
the
automakers
would
be
a
terrible
setback
that
could
destroy
the
economy
.

``
Under
normal
economic
conditions
we
would
prefer
that
markets
determine
the
ultimate
fate
of
private
firms
.

However
,
given
the
current
weakened
state
of
the
US	LOCATION
economy
,
we
will
consider
other
options
if
necessary
-
including
use
of
the
TARP
Troubled
Assets
Relief
Program
]
programme
-
to
prevent
a
collapse
of
troubled
automakers
,
``
said
Dana Perino	PERSON
,
the
White House	LOCATION
Press
Secretary
.

``
A
precipitous
collapse
of
this
industry
would
have
a
severe
impact
on
our
economy
,
and
it
would
be
irresponsible
to
further
weaken
and
destabilize
our
economy
at
this
time
.
``

Earlier
this
week
,
the
``
Big
Three
``
automakers
-
Ford	ORGANIZATION
,
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
,
and
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
-
had
pleaded
before
Congress	ORGANIZATION
to
be
given
$
14
billion
in
funds
so
as
to
prevent
collapse
.

Although
the
House	ORGANIZATION
approved
the
measures
,
the
Senate	ORGANIZATION
voted
the
proposition
down
with
a
vote
of
52-35
.

Part
of
the
failure
of
the
bill
to
pass
was
due
to
disagreements
over
labour
cuts
,
which
the
Republicans
insisted
reach
parity
by
next
year
with
those
of
Japanese
carmakers
.

General Motors	ORGANIZATION
stated
that
the
company
would
stop
30
%
of
its
North
American
production
``
in
response
to
rapidly
deteriorating
market
conditions
``
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
,
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
offer
buyouts
and
early
retirement
to
workers

February
3
,
2009

General Motors	ORGANIZATION
(
GM
)
and
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
have
both
begun
to
offer
layoff
packages
to
their
workforces
.

The
automobile
manufacturers
have
been
hard
hit
in
the
recent
economic
downturn
and
have
been
forced
to
seek
federal
aid
from
the
U.S.	LOCATION
government
.

Reports
say
that
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
package
includes
a
$
20
cash
payment
and
a
$
25
new
vehicle
voucher
.

Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
will
offer
a
$
25
vehicle
voucher
and
$
50
with
healthcare
and
$
75
without
.

Both
will
offer
the
deal
to
most
United Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
(
UAW	ORGANIZATION
)
union
members
-
62
at
GM	ORGANIZATION
,
which
is
seeking
to
cut
31,5
jobs
by
2012
.

The
two
companies
have
received
$
13.4
billion
in
federal
loans
to
keep
them
operating
,
but
Congress	ORGANIZATION
required
them
to
produce
viability
plans
to
demonstrate
they
were
making
significant
cost
cuts
and
labor
concessions
in
return
for
the
money
.

UAW	ORGANIZATION
workers
in
Detroit	LOCATION
earn
$
28
an
hour
``
;
''
their
replacements
will
earn
about
half
that
.

The
UAW	ORGANIZATION
's
``
jobs
bank
``
,
a
system
where
workers
without
duties
are
still
paid
,
has
stopped
at
both
companies
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
is
also
attempting
to
engineer
a
debt-for-equity
swap
,
reducing
its
liabilities
from
$
27.5
billion
in
unsecured
debt
to
$
9.2
billion
.

It
is
also
seeking
to
sell
a
truck
manufacturer
,
the
Delco Electronics	ORGANIZATION
parts
group
and
the
Hummer	PERSON
and
Saab Automobile	ORGANIZATION
vehicle
brands
.

The
entire
motor
manufacturing
sector
has
suffered
under
the
economic
downturn
,
with
the
Ford Motor Company	ORGANIZATION
announcing
a
$
14.6
billion
annual
loss
,
although
it
has
not
sought
federal
aid
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
and
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
both
ran
out
of
operating
funds
in
December
,
leading
to
the
federal
bailout

Industry-wide
US	LOCATION
car
sales
dropped

GM	ORGANIZATION

in
an
effort
to
reduce
its

Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
were
given
loans
worth
US	LOCATION
$
17.4

US	LOCATION
automakers
GM	ORGANIZATION
and
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
seek
more
government
aid

February
18
,
2009

The
United States	LOCATION
auto
manufacturer
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
,
which
has
been
badly
affected
by
the
ongoing
recession
,
has
asked
the
US	LOCATION
government
for
an
additional
US	LOCATION
$
5
billion
in
aid
on
top
of
the
four
billion
it
has
already
received
,
saying
that
it
plans
to
fire
three
thousand
employees
.

At
the
end
of
last
year
,
the
auto
maker
had
just
over
54
employees
,
meaning
that
the
layoffs
will
equal
about
six
percent
of
its
total
workforce
.

In
addition
,
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
will
cut
the
Chrysler Aspen	ORGANIZATION
,
PT
Cruiser
,

.

Another
automaker
,
General Motors	ORGANIZATION

billion
in
loans
from
the
government
,
in
addition
to
the
$
13.4
billion
that
it
has
already
received
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
plans
to
lay
off
47
employees
and
close
five
factories
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
says
that
it
might
need
as
much
as
$
30
billion
from
the
US Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION
,
an
increase
over
their
previous
estimate
of
$
18
billion
.

The
company
has
warned
that
it
might
run
out
of
money
by
March
if
more
aid
was
not
given
.

Rick Wagoner	PERSON
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
chief
executive
,
described
the
firm
's
plan
as
``
comprehensive
,
responsive
,
achievable
,
and
flexible
``
.

``
We
have
a
lot
of
work
in
front
of
us
,
but
I
am
confident
it
will
result
in
a
profitable
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
,
``
he
said
,
adding
that
``
today
's
plan
is
significantly
more
aggressive
because
it
has
to
be
.
``

GM	ORGANIZATION
says
that
it
could
be
profitable
in
two
years
'
time
,
and
might
be
able
to
repay
all
its
loans
by
2017
.

A
third
US	LOCATION
car
manufacturer
,
Ford Motor Company	ORGANIZATION
,
has
said
that
it
can
make
it
through
this
year
without
any
government
aid
.

The
US Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION
will
review
the
car
makers
'
survival
plans
for
several
weeks
before
a
decision
is
made
on
whether
or
not
to
extend
the
loans
.

That
decision
is
due
by
the
end
of
next

GM	ORGANIZATION
and
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
receive
Canadian
loans
amid
US	LOCATION
restructuring
ultimata

April
3
,
2009

General Motors	ORGANIZATION
(
GM
)
and
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
will
receive
bridge
loans
from
the
government
of
Canada	LOCATION
and
the
provincial
government
of
Ontario	LOCATION
,
however
no
more
will
be
forthcoming
from
either
Canadian
or
US	LOCATION
governments
unless
the
companies
can
reinvent
themselves
.

``
This
is
a
regrettable
but
necessary
step
to
protect
the
Canadian
economy
.

We
are
doing
this
on
the
assumption
that
we
obviously
can
not
afford
either
in
the
United States	LOCATION
or
Canada	LOCATION
a
catastrophic
short-term
collapse
.
``

said
Stephen Harper	PERSON
,
Prime
Minister
of
Canada	LOCATION
.

``
We
can
not
,
we
must
not
,
and
we
will
not
let
our
auto
industry
simply
vanish

This
industry
is
,
like
no
other
,
an
emblem
of
the
American
spirit
``
;
''
a
once
and
future
symbol
of
America	LOCATION
's
success
,
``
said
Barack Obama	PERSON
,
President
of
the
United States	LOCATION
.

``
These
companies
-
and
this
industry
-
must
ultimately
stand
on
their
own
,
not
as
wards
of
the
state

``

Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
will
receive
CA
$
1
billion
and
may
in
fact
be
eligible
for
as
much
as
CA
$
4
billion
.

If
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
succeeds
in
the
next
30
days
with
a
restructuring
plan
it
would
be
eligible
for
a
US	LOCATION
$
6
billion
loan
.

A
part
of
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
's
restructuring
plan
must
include
a
partnership
with
Fiat	ORGANIZATION
within
30
days
to
appease
the
US	LOCATION
administration
.

Fiat	ORGANIZATION
is
a
supplier
of
smaller
fuel-efficient
vehicles
,
and
the
merger
will
help
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
to
be
viable
in
the
North
American
market
.

A
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
court
bankruptcy
would
inevitably
lead
to
it
being
sold
off
.

As
a
part
of
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
's
restructuring
plans
,
Tom LaSorda	PERSON
,
the
president
of
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
announced
that
Canadian
operations
would
fold
if
it
does
not
receive
both
the
US	LOCATION
commitment
of
$
2.3
billion
of
aid
and
a
new
Canadian Auto Workers CAW	ORGANIZATION
contract
to
reduce
all-in
costs
by
CA
$
19
per
hour
.

As
a
result
of
this
announcement
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
's
auto
sales
volume
in
Canada	LOCATION
dropped
23
%
compared
to
March
of
2008
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
has
until
the
end
of
May
to
restructure
its
company
to
receive
up
to
CA
$
7.5
billion
.

As
part
of
the
companies
restructuring
,
General Motor	ORGANIZATION
's
chief
executive
Rick Wagoner	PERSON
was
replaced
Sunday
with
Fritz Henderson	PERSON
,
the
current
chief
operating
officer
.

Henderson	PERSON
spoke
out
on
Tuesday
that
GM	ORGANIZATION
has
submitted
a
restructuring
plan
which
would
close
five
plants
,
and
this
may
be
increased
to
meet
the
requirements
for
financial
aid
.

He
is
in
full
compliance
with
Obama	PERSON
's
auto
task
force
to
seek
bankruptcy
if
GM	ORGANIZATION
can
not
negotiate
with
their
unions
,
bondholders
and
others
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
recently
brought
forward
the
``

program
providing
consumer
purchase
protection
for
customers
who
lose
their

for
economic
reasons

As
a
result
of

announcement
in
Canada	LOCATION
,
GM	ORGANIZATION

Canadian
vehicle
sales
volume
fell
only
17.3
%
compared
to
2008

an
increase
from

GM	ORGANIZATION
must
reduce
some
of
its
legacy
costs
which
include
its
pensions
and
union
health
care
costs

A
part
of
GM	ORGANIZATION

ailments
arose
from

an
economy

It

for
bankruptcy
Thursday

lost
US	LOCATION

in
the
first
quarter
of
2009

amidst
heavy
declines
in
revenues

Not
including
special
items
,
the
firm
said
it
had
lost
a
net
$
5.9
billion
dollars
,
or
$
9.66

In
the
first
quarter

GM	ORGANIZATION
had
reported
a
loss
of
$
381

or
$
0.67

Most
financial
analysts
had
forecast
the
automaker
's
losses
to
be
over
$
6.7
billion
,
or
$
11.05

.

GM	ORGANIZATION
had
also
reported
that
it
had
spent
$
10.2
billion
in
an
effort
to
prevent
bankruptcy
.

The
manufacturer
has
received
over
$
15

The

a
deadline
set

``
We
're
focusing
very
much
on

cost
side

you
get

GM	ORGANIZATION
bankruptcy

While
the
GM	ORGANIZATION
equity
today
is
largely
uninvestable
,
we
increasingly
believe
GM	ORGANIZATION
may
emerge
substantially
stronger
from
a
bankruptcy

the

We
recognize
in

we
will
see
some

of
sales

based
on
the
long

the

close
1,1

American
automobile
manufacturer
General Motors ( GM	ORGANIZATION

announced
plans
Friday
to
shut
down
about
1,1
of
its
dealerships
,
in
an
effort
to
evade
bankruptcy
and
lower
its
expenditures
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
's
move
comes
a
day
after
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
,
another
U.S.	LOCATION
car
maker
,
released
a
list
of
789

closing

Unlike

GM	ORGANIZATION

not
publicly
announce

shut
down

Instead

franchises
wo
n't
be
renewed
after
October

will
receive
a
private
letter
telling
them
of
the
decision
.

At
the
moment
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
has
6,246
dealers
in
the
U.S.	LOCATION
.

It
intends
to
reduce
that
number
to
3,605
by
the
end
of
2010
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
said
the
dealerships
that
were
to
be
closed
are
``
underperforming
and
very
small
sales
volume
U.S.	LOCATION
dealers
.
``

``
They
're
dealerships
that
are
in
most
cases
hurting
,
losing
money
,
and
in
danger
of
going
out
of
business
anyway
,
``
said
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
sales
,
service
,
and
marketing
vice
president
in
a
telephone
conference
.

``
It
's
a
move
that
people
could
argue
should
have
been
taken
years
ago
but
this
leadership
team
had
no
choice
but
to
do
it
today
.
``

The
dealers
that
are
to
be
closed
represent
18
%
of
the
firm

dealership
network

only
7

agree
on

would
significantly
reduce
the
firm

costs

Barack Obama	PERSON
presents
rescue
plan
after
GM	ORGANIZATION
declaration
of
bankruptcy

June
1
,
2009

In
a
televised
speech
from
the
White House	LOCATION
at
16:00
UTC
today
,
President
of
the
United States	LOCATION
Barack Obama	PERSON
presented
a
reorganization
plan
following
the
12:00
UTC	ORGANIZATION
announcement
by
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
that
it
had
filed
for
bankruptcy
and
Chapter
11
protection
from
its
creditors
,
the
largest
bankruptcy
of
a
U.S.	LOCATION
manufacturing
company
.

Describing
the
problem
with
the
company
as
one
that
had
been
``
decades
in
the
making
,
``
Obama	PERSON
explained
the
rationale
behind
his
proposed
reorganization
plan
for
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
.

He
stated
that
his
intent
was
not
to
``
perpetuate
]
the
bad
business
decisions
of
the
past
,
``
and
that
loaning
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
money
,
when
debt
was
its
problem
,
would
have
been
doing
exactly
that
.

His
plan
,
he
stated
,
was
for
the
United States	LOCATION
government
,
in
conjunction
with
the
governments
of
Canada	LOCATION
and
Ontario	LOCATION
(
which
he
thanked
for
their
roles
alongside
the
government
of
Germany	LOCATION
which
he
thanked
for
its
role
in
selling
a
corporate
stake
in
GM Europe	ORGANIZATION
)
,
to
become
shareholders
in
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
.

The
United States	LOCATION
government
would
hold
a
60
%
stake
.

The
government
will
give
GM	ORGANIZATION
a
capital
infusion
of
US	LOCATION
$
30
billion
in
addition
to
the
funds
it
has
already
received
.

Of
the
government
ownership
he
stated
that
he
refused
``
to
let
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
and
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
become
wards
of
the
state
``
,
and
described
the
bankruptcy
of
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
,
and
the
bankruptcy
of
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
that
he
envisioned
as
being
``
quick
,
surgical
,
bankruptcies
``
.

He
pointed
to
the
bankruptcy
of
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
as
an
example
of
what
he
envision
for
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
,
but
stated
that
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
was
a
``
more
complex
company
``
than
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
.

Responding
to
challenges
voiced
by
political
opponents
,
before
the
speech
,
that
the
federal
government
would
actively
participate
in
the
affairs
of
the
restructured
company
,
he
stated
that
he
had
``
no
interest
``
in
running
GM	ORGANIZATION
,
and
that
the
federal
government
would
``
refrain
from
exercising
its
rights
``
as
a
corporate
shareholder
for
the
most
part
.

In
particular
,
he
stated
that
the
federal
government
would
not
exercise
its
rights
as
a
shareholder
to
dictate
``
what
new
type

CEO
of
GM	ORGANIZATION
outlines
plan
for
``
New GM	ORGANIZATION
``
after
auto
company
declared
bankruptcy

June
4
,
2009

In
a
New York	LOCATION
press
conference
at
16:15
UTC	ORGANIZATION
,
June
1st
,
Fritz Henderson	PERSON
,
the
Chief
Executive
Officer
of
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
,
which
filed
for
bankruptcy
and
Chapter
11
protection
from
its
creditors
earlier
today
,
outlined
a
plan
for
what
he
called
a
``
New
GM
``
.

Speaking
to
the
press
under
safe
harbor
provisions
of
U.S.	LOCATION
law
,
Henderson	PERSON
described
the
events
of
today
as
a
``
defining
moment
``
in
the
history
of
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
.

Speaking
to
the
public
he
said
that
``
The
GM	ORGANIZATION
that
let
you
down
is
history
,
``
and
described
a
``
New
GM
``
that
he
expected
to
result
from
the
bankruptcy
process
.

Henderson	PERSON
stated
that
he
envisioned
the
bankruptcy
process
would
take
between
60
and
90
days
.

He
stressed
several
times
his
view
that
the
process
would
be
one
that
is
executed
quickly
,
saying
that
not
just
a
sense
of
urgency
but
``
pure
unadulterated
speed
``
was
his
expectation
of
the
process
.

He
emphasized
that
``
GM	ORGANIZATION
remains
open
for
business
``
during
the
bankruptcy
period
,
continuing
to
sell
and
to
support
its
products
,
and
that
day
one
motions
had
been
filed
in
the
bankruptcy
court
in
order
to
allow
this
.

Regarding
the
bankruptcy
process
he
said
,
``
We
will
do
it
right
.

And
we
will
do
it
once
.
``

He
stated
that
the
plan
for
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
had
the
support
of
the
United Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
,
the
Canadian Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
,
the
GM VEBA	ORGANIZATION
,
and
a
majority
of
the
unsecured
bondholders
of
GM	ORGANIZATION
.

He
also
mentioned
that
GM	ORGANIZATION
had
already
received
$
1.5
million
in
bridge
financing
from
the
German
government
.

In
response
to
questions
about
the
possibility
of
the
United States	LOCATION
federal
government
,
a
majority
shareholder
in
the
restructured
company
,
dictating
future
product
development
and
strategy
,
such
as
the
sale
of
more
fuel-efficient
and
green
vehicles
``
;
''
he
first
observed
that
the
federal
government
had
already
stated
to
him
that
it
had
``
no
real
interest
in
running
our
business
``
and
that
he
expected
that
still
to
be
his
job
.

Of
the
specific
hypothetical
scenario
where
the
management
of
GM	ORGANIZATION
wants
to
make
one
type
of
car
,
because
it
thinks
that
it
is
the
right
thing
for
the
business
,
and
the
U.S.	LOCATION
government
wants
to
make
another
type
of
car
,
he
stated
that
``
I
do
n't
think
it
's
going
to
happen
.
``

Expanding
on
that
point
he
stated
that
he
expected
the
``
New
GM
``
to
focus
upon
``
highly
fuel-efficient
and
green
technology
``
,
and
that
operating
both
in
accordance
with
U.S.	LOCATION
environmental
laws
and
in
response
to
customer
demand
would
naturally
result
in
the
New
GM
producing
the
types
of
vehicles
that
the
U.S.	LOCATION
government
would
encourage
.

The
``
New GM	ORGANIZATION
``
he
also
expected
to
focus
on
``
four
core
brands
``
,
and
will
size
its
dealership
to
match
that
.

He
stated
that
GM	ORGANIZATION
would
offer
a
``
deferred
termination
``
package
to
dealers
,
to
allow
them
to
cease
dealing
in
GM	ORGANIZATION
vehicles
in
a
managed
and
gradual
way
.

He
stated
that
the
bankruptcy
filings
did
not
cover
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
'
businesses
in
Latin America	LOCATION
,
Europe	LOCATION
and
the
Middle East	LOCATION
,
and
Asia	LOCATION
and
the
Pacific	LOCATION
.

Of
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
profitable
ventures
in
China	LOCATION
,
specifically
,
he
stated
that
they
were
``
a
critical
part
of
the
New
GM
``
.

In
response
to
questions
of
whether
the
New GM	ORGANIZATION
would
import
cars
from
China	LOCATION
to
the
U.S.	LOCATION
,
he
stated
the
formative
company
's
core
principle
that
``
We
build
where
we
sell
``
applied
in
both
directions
,
with
GM	ORGANIZATION
building
in
China	LOCATION
to
sell
in
China	LOCATION
and
building
in
the
U.S.	LOCATION
to
sell
in
the
U.S.	LOCATION
,
stating
that
this
shortened
supply
chains
.

He
declined
to
predict
when
the
New
GM
would
return
to
profitability
,
stating
that
the
goal
was
rather
to
lower
the
break-even
EBIT	ORGANIZATION
point
for
the
company
.

He
also
declined
to
speculate
upon
when
the
U.S.	LOCATION
government
would
sell
its
stake
in
the
company
,
saying
that
that
was
a
question
``
better
addressed
to
the
U.S. Treasury	ORGANIZATION
``
,
and
merely
saying
that
he
expected
it
to
be
``
years
,
not
months
``
when
the
U.S. Treasury	ORGANIZATION
felt
it
would
give
``
the
right
return
for
taxpayers
.

According

Penske	PERSON
future

Automobile
manufacturer
Ford	ORGANIZATION
posts
unexpected
profits

November
3
,
2009

The
US	LOCATION
automobile
manufacturer
Ford	ORGANIZATION
has
said
that
it
posted
a
net
profit
of
US	LOCATION
$
997
million
in
the
third
quarter
of
this
year
,
and
predicted
that
it
would
be
``
solidly
profitable
``
by
2011
.

The
reports
surprised
most
analysts
,
who
had
forecast
that
the
auto
company
would
lose
money
.

Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
profits
equate
to
26
cents
per
share
,
a
large
difference
to
the
12
cent
per
share
lost
that
had
been
anticipated
by
most
economic
analysts
.

``
Our
third-quarter
results
clearly
show
Ford	ORGANIZATION

making
tremendous
progress
despite
the
prolonged
economic
slump

``
said
the

chief

``
While

still
face
a
challenging
road
ahead

our
transformation

our
underlying
business
continues

``

Mulally	PERSON
predicted
that
his

would
meet
or
even
surpass
all
of
its
financial
targets

suggested
that
the
fourth

of
this

could
see
it

According

the

wanted

present

it

Ford Motors	ORGANIZATION
posts
US	LOCATION
$
2.7
billion
annual
profit

January
28
,
2010

Ford Motors Co.	ORGANIZATION
,
the
automobile
manufacturing
firm
,
has
posted
an
annual
profit
for
the
last
year
of
US	LOCATION
$
2.7
billion
,
the
first
gain
for
four
years
.

The
statistics
are
an
improvement
from
2008
,
when
the
car
company
posted
a
loss
of
close
to
$
15
billion
.

For
the
final
quarter
of
2009
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
says
it
made
profits
of
$
868
million
,
and
expects
to
continue
to
be
profitable
this
year
.

The
company
had
cut
its
costs
to
$
118.3
billion
last
year
,
$
19.8
billion
than
the
year
previous
.

Ford	ORGANIZATION
had
a
$
34.3
billion
debt
at
the
end
of
2009
.

In
the
fourth
quarter
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
brand
sales
were
up
thirteen
percent
compared
to
the
same
time
in
2008
in
the
US	LOCATION
,
and
obtained
15.3
%
of
the

market
in
the
country

The

and
chief
executive
,
Alan Mulally	PERSON
,
commented
on
the
profits
.

``
While
we
still
face
significant
challenges
ahead

2009
was
a
pivotal
year
for

the
strongest
proof
yet
that
our
One
Ford	ORGANIZATION
plan
is
working
and
that
we
are
forging
a
path

Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
US	LOCATION
auto
sales
spike
,
surpassing
GM	ORGANIZATION

March
3
,
2010

Ford Motor Company	ORGANIZATION
said
on
Tuesday
that
its
sales
in
the
United States	LOCATION
rose
43
%
in
February
compared
to
the
same
period
last
year
,
as
the
automaker
outsold
rivals
Toyota	ORGANIZATION
and
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
.

Ford	ORGANIZATION
said
that
total
sales
improved
to
142,285
units
,
compared
to
141,951
units
sold
by
GM	ORGANIZATION
.

Additionally
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
said
that
its
share
of
the
total
US	LOCATION
car
market
rose
to
17
%
,
up
from
14
%
a
year
ago
.

The
increase
was
better
than
analysts
had
predicted
,
and
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
stock
rose
to
a
five-year
high
in
morning
trading
,
before
declining
later
in
the
day
.

Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
sales
were
significantly
influenced
by
a
74
%
increase
in
fleet
sales
to
businesses
.

Rental
car
agencies
alone
accounted
for
around
30
units
sold
.

Sales
to
retail
consumers
increased
only
28
%
.

The
increases
were
led
by
sales
of
two
sedans
,
the
Fusion
and
Taurus
,
which
rose
166.5
and
93.3
%
respectively
,
although
sales
of
other
models
such
as
SUVs
and
pickup
trucks
also
increased
.

Both
models
were
significantly
redesigned
last
year
,
and
analysts
said
that
improved
quality
from
such
cars
were
driving
the
increases
.

Other
companies
also
reported
February
sales
today
,
nearly
all
reporting
sales
gains
as
well
,
although
none
as
large
as
those
of
Ford	ORGANIZATION
.

Toyota	ORGANIZATION
was
the
sole
exception
to
the
sales
gains
,
as
their
sales
declined
8.7
%
,
as
the
company
was
faced
with
a
global
recall
during
the
month
that
led
to
a
temporary
stoppage
of
production
for
some
models
.

``
The
strength
of
our
new
products
...
are
resonating
with
customers
,
``
said
Ken Czubay	PERSON
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
vice
president
of
sales
and
marketing
.

However
,
he
believed
that
traditional
Toyota	ORGANIZATION
customers
were
not
buying
rival
autos
,
but
rather
awaiting
the
results
from
the
recalls
.

Fiat	ORGANIZATION
plans
to
buy
majority
stake
in
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION

May
29
,
2011

Fiat	ORGANIZATION
announced
on
Friday
that
it
intends
to
purchase
the
six
percent
of
automaker
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
that
the
US	LOCATION
government
currently
owns
,
which
would
give
the
Italian
company
a
52
percent
majority
stake
in
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
.

According
to
Fiat	ORGANIZATION
's
announcement
,
the
company
has
told
the
US Treasury	ORGANIZATION
that
it
intends
to
use
its
option
to
buy
the
share
in
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
held
by
the
US	LOCATION
government
,
a
deal
that
will
be
finalized
by
June
10
.

If
a
price
is
not
agreed
on
by
that
time
,
Fiat	ORGANIZATION
will
pay
the
average
of
the
estimates
of
two
investment
banks
.

In
2009
,
Fiat	ORGANIZATION
bought
a
twenty
percent
stake
in
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
,
which
had
just
exited
bankruptcy
,
and
has
since
increased
its
holding
to
46
percent
,
expected
to
increase
to
57
%
by
the
end
of
this
year
.

According
to
analyst
Maryann Keller	PERSON
,
the
deal
is
a
good
one
for
both
companies
,
as
``
n
]
either
one
has
the
ability
to
compete
alone
in
the
kind
of
global
environment
that
they
face
.
``

Analyst
Rebecca Lindland	PERSON
said
that
the
move
will
also
benefit
the
companies
by
getting
``
them
out
from
underneath
any
hint
of
government
ownership
and
any
of
that
negativity
that
went
along
with
the
bailout

To
accomplish
this
30
jobs
which
make
up
20
to
25
percent
of
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
North
American
workforce
of
122
people
will
be
cut
and
14
plants
will
be
closed
in
order
to
bring
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
production
capacity
in
line
with
demand
.

By
the
end
of
this
year
,
the
Atlanta	LOCATION
and
St. Louis	LOCATION
plants
will
be
closed
.

Atlanta	LOCATION
makes
the
Ford
Taurus
sedan
,
which
is
being
phased
out
.

The
St. Louis	LOCATION
plant
is
one
of
two
plants
that
manufactures
the
Ford	ORGANIZATION
Explorer
,
whose
sales
had
a
29
%
decline
in
2005
.

It
will
also
close
its
Wixom	LOCATION
,
Michigan	LOCATION
plant
,
Batavia Transmission	LOCATION
in
Ohio	LOCATION
the
Windsor
Casting
plant
in
Ontario	LOCATION
which
was
previously
announced
by
Ford	ORGANIZATION
that
it
was
to
be
closed
after
contract
negotiations
with
the
Canadian Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
.

The
plant
in
St. Thomas	LOCATION
,
Ontario	LOCATION
plant
will
have
one
shift
cut
from
it
.

The
plant
makes
the
Crown Victoria	LOCATION
and
Grand Marquis	LOCATION
cars
.

On
this
cut
of
the
one
shift
,
Whitey MacDonald	PERSON
,
chairperson
of
Local
1520
,
Canadian Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
said
``
There
is
a
lot
of
anger
here
today
,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
.

Any
time
a
plant
goes
to
one
shift
,
it
puts
them
in
limbo
.

This
car
has
made
the
company
millions
of
dollars
over
the
years
they
have
invested
in
other
products
and
locations
-
we
are
entitled
to
some
new
investment
given
our
track
record
.
``

Positive
news
for
the
plant
is
that
Ford	ORGANIZATION
is
still
committed
to
invest
$
200
million
into
the
plant
to
upgrade
the
appearance
of
the
two
cars
manufactured
there
.

On
the
contrary
,
according
to
Automotive
analyst
Dennis DesRosier	PERSON
believes
that
the
factory
is
still
``
likely
``
to
close
.

DesRoiser	PERSON
said
,
``
The
St. Thomas	LOCATION
plant
is
old
,
the
product
is
old
,
it
make
sense
it
is
on
that
list
.

This
may
be
just
a
short-term
reprieve
,
it
may
be
look
at
permanent
closure
in
two
to
three
years
.
``

Two
more
plants
will
close
in
2008
,
another
two
in
2012
.

Two
more
plants
to
be
closed
are
to
be
announced
later
this
year
.

Also
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
will
fire
12
%
of
its
53
executive
officers
.

Due
to
the
company
's
current
contract
with
the
United Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
,
workers
at
the
idled
plants
will
still
be
receiving
their
pay
and
benefits
until
Ford	ORGANIZATION
negotiates
a
new
contract
with
the
union
.

However
,
the
workers
may
not
earn
what
they
earn
today
because
they
will
not
be
eligible
for
overtime
.

The
UAW	ORGANIZATION
President
Ron Gettelfinger	PERSON
and
Vice
President
Gerald Bantom	PERSON
called
say
the
plan
is
``
extremely
disappointing
.
``

The
UAW	ORGANIZATION
issued
statement
saying
``
The
impacted
hourly
and
salaried
workers
find
themselves
facing
uncertain
futures
because
of
senior
management
's
failure
to
halt
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
sliding
market
share
.

The
announcement
has
further
left
a
cloud
hanging
over
the
entire
work
force
because
of
pending
future
announcements
of
additional
facilities
to
be
closed
at
some
point
in
the
future

GM	ORGANIZATION

(ORGANIZATIO
  General
  Motors
  Corporation
  (
  GM
)
has
posted
its
first
annual
loss
since
1992
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
reported
losing
US	LOCATION
$
4.8
billion
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
2005
and
a
total
loss
of
$
8.6
billion
for
the
entire
year
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
admitted
Thursday
night
that
the
loss
could
swell
further
as
it
pays
pensions
and
healthcare
costs
to
thousands
of
former
workers
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
warned
that
the
amount
calculated
for
last
year
is
preliminary
and
could
rise
before
it
is
officially
reported
to
the
US	LOCATION
securities
and
exchanges
commission
in
March
.

The
loss
was
far
greater
than
analysts
predicted
.

Ford	ORGANIZATION
,
the
second
of
the
big
three
American
car
manufacturers
,
beat
predictions
earlier
in
the
week
.

In
contrast
,
Toyota	ORGANIZATION
is
expected
to
report
that
it
will
beat
last
year
's
profit
of
$
11
billion
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
's
automotive
division
lost
$
1.5
billion
in
the
fourth
quarter
,
driven
by
losses
in
North America	LOCATION
.

This
has
been
attributed
to
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
shrinking
market
share
,
which
has
been
taken
by
Japanese
manufacturers
Toyota	ORGANIZATION
and
Nissan	ORGANIZATION
.

A
further
$
1.3
billion
was
lost
in
restructuring
charges
.

As
part
of
the
restructure
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
plans
to
cut
30
jobs
and
close
12
facilities
by
2008
.

An
aide
for
Kirk Kerkorian	PERSON
,
GMs
largest
individual
investor
(
at
9.9
%
)
,
has
called
on
the

to
halve

cut

Australian
government
announces
$
52.5
million
financial
assistance
package
for
Ford	ORGANIZATION

May
5
,
2006

Australian
Prime
Minister
John Howard	PERSON
and
federal
industry
minister
Ian MacDonald	PERSON
today
announced
that
the
federal
government
would
be
providing
Ford Australia	ORGANIZATION
with
a
AU
$
52.5
million
(
US	LOCATION
$
40.4
million
)
``
financial
assistance
package
``
.

Additional
assistance
will
also
be
provided
by
the
Victorian
state
government
.

According
to
Mr
Howard	PERSON
,
the
injection
will
secure
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
manufacturing
operations
in
Australia	LOCATION
``
for
the
long
term
``
.

From
the
package
,
AU
$
40
million
will
be
used
for
the
design
and
manufacture
of
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
next
model
Falcon	ORGANIZATION
and
Territory
vehicles
,
which
will
be
built
in
Australia	LOCATION
.

Despite
being
given
a
major
facelift
in
2002
and
another
in
2005
,
the
Falcon
's
bodyshell
dates
back
to
1998
.

The
current
Falcon	ORGANIZATION
will
need
to
serve
the
company
until
at
least
2007
when
the
new
model
is
anticipated
.

In
the
meantime
,
it
will
face
stiff
competition
from
the
completely
new
Holden Commodore	ORGANIZATION
(
the
Falcon
's
major
competitor
)
which
will
be
released
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
.

The
additional
AU
$
12.5
million
will
be
spent
on
the
development
of
a
light
commercial
vehicle
platform
,
which
will
be
built
overseas
and
marketed
to
around
80
countries
.

Mr
Howard	PERSON
said
that
the
light
commercial
project
would
involve
construction
of
a
research
and
development
centre
,
which
will
become
the
base
for
R
&
D
projects
in
the
region
.

Mr
MacFarlane	PERSON
said
that
the
research
facility
was
exciting
for
Australia	LOCATION
and
that
it
would
put
the
Australian
automotive
in
the
spotlight
.

``
The
funding
has
helped
Ford Australia	ORGANIZATION
secure
the
largest
automotive
R
&
D
project
ever
undertaken
in
Australia	LOCATION
which
is
equally
exciting
news
for
local
Ford	ORGANIZATION
employees
and
Australian
component
producers
``
he
said
.

``
The
project
will
see
Ford Australia	ORGANIZATION
become
a
centre
for
automotive
design
and
engineering
excellence
in
the
Asia Pacific	LOCATION
region
which
will
bring
spin-off
benefits
for
the
broader
industry
,
``
``
This
opportunity
will
put
both
Ford Australia	ORGANIZATION
,
and
the
Australian
automotive
and
components
sectors
on
the
world
map
as
far
as
our
automotive
design
and
engineering
capabilities
are
concerned
.
``

Mr
(PERSO
MacFarlane
said
.

Mr
Howard	PERSON
claims
that
the
projects
will
create
273
jobs
and
secure
the
future
of
the
``
iconic
``
Ford Falcon	ORGANIZATION
,
which
has
been
built
in
Australia	LOCATION
since
1960
.

The
financial
package
is
conditional
upon
Ford Australia	ORGANIZATION
giving
the
Australian
automotive
component
industry
an
opportunity
to
supply
components
for
the
vehicles
produced
by
the
two
projects
.

announces
deep
production
cuts
in
response
to
growing
losses

August

Ford	ORGANIZATION
has
announced
sweeping
cuts
of
21
%
(
168

)
in
its
US	LOCATION
and
Canadian
production
,
resulting
in
the
partial
closure
of

The
measure

in
which
25

30
positions

be
cut
and
14
plants
closed

Ford	ORGANIZATION
is
the
world

third-largest
automaker
and
the
U.S.	LOCATION
's
second-largest
.

However
it
has
in
recent
years
been
struggling
with
poor
profitability
and
shrinking
market
shares
.

In
2005
it
lost
$
1.6

and
recently
the
company

loss
of
$
254

and
a
34

George Pipas	PERSON

points
to
rising
gas
prices
having
negative
impact
on
the
sale

(ORGANIZATIO
Ford
Taurus
to
be
revived

February

thumb
Ford Motor Company	ORGANIZATION
CEO
Alan Mulally	PERSON
has
reported
that
Ford	ORGANIZATION
will
rename
the
Ford	ORGANIZATION
Five
Hundred
to
the
Taurus
for
the
2008
model
year
,
when
a
facelifted
model
is
expected
to
be
launched
to
improve
the
lackluster
sales
of
the
outgoing
model
.

Mulally	PERSON
says
that
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
decision
to
name
all
their
cars
with
the
letter
F
was
a
lackluster
move
,
and
makes
their
names
easily
forgettable
.

As
a
result
,
Mulally	PERSON
plans
on
reviving
many
respected
Ford	ORGANIZATION
nameplates
,
the
Taurus
being
one
of
them
,
and
the
Falcon
possibly
in
the
future
.

The
Ford
Taurus
was
originally
introduced
in
1986
,
and
was
a
revolutionary
car
that
rewrote
the
rules
for
creating
a
sedan
,
and
pushed
the
other
American
automakers
to
follow
suit
,
leading
to
a
design
revolution
that
completely
rid
Detroit	LOCATION
of
the
``
boxy
``
cars
of
the
70s
and
80s
.

The
Taurus
survived
for
four
generations
,
selling
over
7,500,000
units
.

The
Taurus
was
discontinued
in
October
2006
,
after
a
brief
run
of
2007
models
destined
for
fleet
customers
.

``
How
can
it
go
away
?
``

Alan Mulally	PERSON
remembered
asking
,
``
It
's
the
best-selling
car
in
America	LOCATION
.
``

While
it
is
not
expected
for
the
name
change
to
turn
the
Five
Hundred
into
a
400
plus
units
a
year
blockbuster
like
the
Taurus
,
it
is
expected
to
make
sales
more
solid
,
and
to
make
the
car
well
known
,
since
the
Taurus
is
a
well
known
nameplate
around
the
country
