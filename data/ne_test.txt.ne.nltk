US	GSP
automaker

Senate	ORGANIZATION

December

2008

A

the
``
Big

Chrysler	PERSON

and
General	ORGANIZATION

--
has
been
rejected
in
the
United States	GPE
Senate	ORGANIZATION
after
failing
a
procedural
vote
.

The
bill
was
rejected
after
bipartisan
discussions
on
the
bailout
broke
down
when
Republican Party	ORGANIZATION
leaders
insisted
that
the
United Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
(
UAW	ORGANIZATION

union
agree
to
increase
wage

next
year
in
order
to
bring

The
UAW	ORGANIZATION
refused

meet
the

The

52-35

eight

Only
ten

joined
forty
Democrats

two

Three

voted
with
thirty-one

Majority

said
that
he
was
``
terribly
disappointed
``
by
the
failure
of
the
bill
to
pass

``
I
dread
looking
at
Wall Street	FACILITY
tomorrow
.

It
's
not
going
to
be
a
pleasant
sight
,
``
Reid	PERSON
said
.

``
Millions
of
Americans	GPE
,
not
only
the
auto
workers
but
people
who
sell
cars
,
car

,
people
who
work
on
cars
are
going
to
be
directly
impacted
and
affected
.
``

Republican	ORGANIZATION
Senator
Bob Corker	PERSON
was
also
unhappy
about
the
rejection
.

``
We
were
about
three
words
away
from
a
deal
.

We
solved
everything
substantively
and
about
three
words
keep
us
from
reaching
a
conclusion
,
``
he
said
.

Some
Democrats
now
want
U.S.	GPE
President
Bush	PERSON
to
reserve
a
portion
of
the
$
700
billion
bailout
package
earmarked
for
Wall Street	FACILITY
to
assist
the
flagging
car
industry
.

Stock	GPE

fell
dramatically
on

White	FACILITY
House	ORGANIZATION
considering
auto
rescue
plan

December
13
,
2008

After
a
plan
to
bail
out
three
large
American	GPE
auto
companies
failed
to
pass
the
Senate	ORGANIZATION
this
week
,
the
White House	FACILITY
has
said
that
it
is
considering
using
some
of
the
US	ORGANIZATION
$
700
billion
earmarked
to
rescue
the
banking
industry
to
bail
out
the
automakers
.

The
White House	FACILITY
says
that
the
collapse
of
the
automakers
would
be
a
terrible
setback
that
could
destroy
the
economy
.

``
Under
normal
economic
conditions
we
would
prefer
that
markets
determine
the
ultimate
fate
of
private
firms
.

However
,
given
the
current
weakened
state
of
the
US	GSP
economy
,
we
will
consider
other
options
if
necessary
-
including
use
of
the
TARP Troubled Assets	ORGANIZATION
Relief
Program
]
programme
-
to
prevent
a
collapse
of
troubled
automakers
,
``
said
Dana Perino	PERSON
,
the
White House	FACILITY
Press
Secretary
.

``
A
precipitous
collapse
of
this
industry
would
have
a
severe
impact
on
our
economy
,
and
it
would
be
irresponsible
to
further
weaken
and
destabilize
our
economy
at
this
time
.
``

Earlier
this
week
,
the
``
Big
Three
``
automakers
-
Ford	GPE
,
Chrysler	PERSON
,
and
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
-
had
pleaded
before
Congress	ORGANIZATION
to
be
given
$
14
billion
in
funds
so
as
to
prevent
collapse
.

Although
the
House	ORGANIZATION
approved
the
measures
,
the
Senate	ORGANIZATION
voted
the
proposition
down
with
a
vote
of
52-35
.

Part	GPE
of
the
failure
of
the
bill
to
pass
was
due
to
disagreements
over
labour
cuts
,
which
the
Republicans
insisted
reach
parity
by
next
year
with
those
of
Japanese	GPE
carmakers
.

General
Motors	PERSON
stated
that
the
company
would
stop
30
%
of
its
North	GPE
American	GPE
production
``
in
response
to
rapidly
deteriorating
market
conditions
``

GM
,
Chrysler	PERSON
offer
buyouts
and
early
retirement
to
workers

February
3
,
2009

General
Motors
(
GM
)
and
Chrysler	PERSON
have
both
begun
to
offer
layoff
packages
to
their
workforces
.

The
automobile
manufacturers
have
been
hard
hit
in
the
recent
economic
downturn
and
have
been
forced
to
seek
federal
aid
from
the
U.S.	GPE
government
.

Reports
say
that
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
package
includes
a
$
20
cash
payment
and
a
$
25
new
vehicle
voucher
.

Chrysler	PERSON
will
offer
a
$
25
vehicle
voucher
and
$
50
with
healthcare
and
$
75
without
.

Both
will
offer
the
deal
to
most
United Auto	GPE
Workers
(
UAW	ORGANIZATION
)
union
members
-
62
at
GM	ORGANIZATION
,
which
is
seeking
to
cut
31,5
jobs
by
2012
.

The
two
companies
have
received
$
13.4
billion
in
federal
loans
to
keep
them
operating
,
but
Congress	ORGANIZATION
required
them
to
produce
viability
plans
to
demonstrate
they
were
making
significant
cost
cuts
and
labor
concessions
in
return
for
the
money
.

UAW
workers
in
Detroit	GPE
earn
$
28
an
hour
``
;
''
their
replacements
will
earn
about
half
that
.

The
UAW	ORGANIZATION
's
``
jobs
bank
``
,
a
system
where
workers
without
duties
are
still
paid
,
has
stopped
at
both
companies
.

GM
is
also
attempting
to
engineer
a
debt-for-equity
swap
,
reducing
its
liabilities
from
$
27.5
billion
in
unsecured
debt
to
$
9.2
billion
.

It
is
also
seeking
to
sell
a
truck
manufacturer
,
the
Delco Electronics	ORGANIZATION
parts
group
and
the
Hummer	ORGANIZATION
and
Saab Automobile	PERSON
vehicle
brands
.

The
entire
motor
manufacturing
sector
has
suffered
under
the
economic
downturn
,
with
the
Ford Motor	ORGANIZATION
Company
announcing
a
$
14.6
billion
annual
loss
,
although
it
has
not
sought
federal
aid
.

GM
and
Chrysler	PERSON
both
ran
out
of
operating
funds
in
December
,
leading
to
the
federal
bailout
.

of
55
%
.

The
decline
in
sales
has
not
been
limited
to
just
US
manufacturers

sales
from
a
year
earlier
,
Nissan Motors	PERSON
dropped
30

,
and
Honda	GPE
sales
dropped

.

Subaru	GPE
and
South Korean	GPE
Hyundai Motor Company	PERSON
were
two
of
the
few
auto
firms
that
reported
an
increase
in
sales
.

They
posted
gains
of
eight
and
fourteen
percent
,
respectively
.

On
an
annual
basis
,

been
plummeting
.

Industry-wide
US	GSP
car
sales
dropped
18
%
last
year
to

million
automobiles

GM
announced
today
that
it
will
offer
voluntary
buyouts
to
22
employees
in
the
US	GSP
,
in
an
effort
to
reduce
its
expenditures
.

Last
month
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
and
Chrysler	PERSON
were
given
loans
worth
US
$
17.4
billion
from
the
government
after
they
warned
of
imminent
bankruptcy
.

US
automakers
GM
and
Chrysler	PERSON
seek
more
government
aid

February
18
,
2009

The
United States	GPE
auto
manufacturer
Chrysler	PERSON
,
which
has
been
badly
affected
by
the
ongoing
recession
,
has
asked
the
US	GPE
government
for
an
additional
US
$
5
billion
in
aid
on
top
of
the
four
billion
it
has
already
received
,
saying
that
it
plans
to
fire
three
thousand
employees
.

At
the
end
of
last
year
,
the
auto
maker
had
just
over
54
employees
,
meaning
that
the
layoffs
will
equal
about
six
percent
of
its
total
workforce
.

In
addition
,
Chrysler	PERSON
will
cut
the
Chrysler Aspen	ORGANIZATION
,
PT Cruiser	ORGANIZATION
,
and
Durango	PERSON
from
production
.

Another
automaker
,
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
(
GM

,
announced
that
it
seeks
$
16.6
billion
in
loans
from
the
government
,
in
addition
to
the
$
13.4
billion
that
it
has
already
received
.

GM
plans
to
lay
off
47
employees
and
close
five
factories
.

GM
says
that
it
might
need
as
much
as
$
30
billion
from
the
US Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION
,
an
increase
over
their
previous
estimate
of
$
18
billion
.

The
company
has
warned
that
it
might
run
out
of
money
by
March
if
more
aid
was
not
given
.

Rick Wagoner	PERSON
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
chief
executive
,
described
the
firm
's
plan
as
``
comprehensive
,
responsive
,
achievable
,
and
flexible
``
.

``
We
have
a
lot
of
work
in
front
of
us
,
but
I
am
confident
it
will
result
in
a
profitable
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
,
``
he
said
,
adding
that
``
today
's
plan
is
significantly
more
aggressive
because
it
has
to
be
.
``

GM
says
that
it
could
be
profitable
in
two
years
'
time
,
and
might
be
able
to
repay
all
its
loans
by
2017
.

A
third
US	GSP
car
manufacturer
,
Ford Motor Company	ORGANIZATION
,
has
said
that
it
can
make
it
through
this
year
without
any
government
aid
.

The
US Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION
will
review
the
car
makers
'
survival
plans
for
several
weeks
before
a
decision
is
made
on
whether
or
not
to
extend
the
loans
.

That
decision
is
due
by
the
end
of

GM
and
Chrysler	PERSON
receive
Canadian	GPE
loans
amid
US	GSP
restructuring
ultimata

April
3
,
2009

General
Motors
(
GM
)
and
Chrysler	PERSON
will
receive
bridge
loans
from
the
government
of
Canada	GPE
and
the
provincial
government
of
Ontario	GPE
,
however
no
more
will
be
forthcoming
from
either
Canadian	GPE
or
US	GSP
governments
unless
the
companies
can
reinvent
themselves
.

``
This
is
a
regrettable
but
necessary
step
to
protect
the
Canadian	GPE
economy
.

We
are
doing
this
on
the
assumption
that
we
obviously
can
not
afford
either
in
the
United States	GPE
or
Canada	GPE
a
catastrophic
short-term
collapse
.
``

said
Stephen Harper	PERSON
,
Prime
Minister
of
Canada	GPE
.

``
We
can
not
,
we
must
not
,
and
we
will
not
let
our
auto
industry
simply
vanish
.

This
industry
is
,
like
no
other
,
an
emblem
of
the
American	GPE
spirit
``
;
''
a
once
and
future
symbol
of
America	GPE
's
success
,
``
said
Barack Obama	PERSON
,
President
of
the
United States	GPE
.

``
These
companies
-
and
this
industry
-
must
ultimately
stand
on
their
own
,
not
as
wards
of
the
state

``

Chrysler	PERSON
will
receive
CA
$
1
billion
and
may
in
fact
be
eligible
for
as
much
as
CA
$
4
billion
.

If
Chrysler	PERSON
succeeds
in
the
next
30
days
with
a
restructuring
plan
it
would
be
eligible
for
a
US
$
6
billion
loan
.

A
part
of
Chrysler	PERSON
's
restructuring
plan
must
include
a
partnership
with
Fiat	PERSON
within
30
days
to
appease
the
US	GSP
administration
.

Fiat	GPE
is
a
supplier
of
smaller
fuel-efficient
vehicles
,
and
the
merger
will
help
Chrysler	PERSON
to
be
viable
in
the
North	LOCATION
American	GPE
market
.

A
Chrysler	ORGANIZATION
court
bankruptcy
would
inevitably
lead
to
it
being
sold
off
.

As
a
part
of
Chrysler	PERSON
's
restructuring
plans
,
Tom LaSorda	PERSON
,
the
president
of
Chrysler	PERSON
announced
that
Canadian	GPE
operations
would
fold
if
it
does
not
receive
both
the
US	GSP
commitment
of
$
2.3
billion
of
aid
and
a
new
Canadian	GPE
Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
CAW	ORGANIZATION
contract
to
reduce
all-in
costs
by
CA
$
19
per
hour
.

As
a
result
of
this
announcement
Chrysler	PERSON
's
auto
sales
volume
in
Canada	GPE
dropped
23
%
compared
to
March
of
2008
.

GM
has
until
the
end
of
May
to
restructure
its
company
to
receive
up
to
CA
$
7.5
billion
.

As
part
of
the
companies
restructuring
,
General Motor	ORGANIZATION
's
chief
executive
Rick Wagoner	PERSON
was
replaced
Sunday
with
Fritz Henderson	PERSON
,
the
current
chief
operating
officer
.

Henderson	PERSON
spoke
out
on

that
GM	ORGANIZATION
has
submitted
a
restructuring
plan
which
would
close
five
plants

and
this
may
be
increased
to
meet

auto
task
force
to
seek
bankruptcy
if
GM
can
not
negotiate
with
their
unions

volume
fell
only
17.3

The

amidst
heavy
declines
in
revenues

Not
including

items

the
firm
said
it
had
lost
a
net
$
5.9
billion
dollars
,
or
$
9.66

In
the
first
quarter

year
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
had
reported
a
loss
of
$
381

or
$
0.67

Most
financial
analysts
had
forecast
the
automaker
's
losses
to
be
over
$
6.7
billion
,
or
$
11.05

share
.

GM
had
also
reported
that
it
had
spent
$
10.2
billion
in
an
effort
to
prevent
bankruptcy
.

The
manufacturer
has
received
over
$
15
billion
in
bailout
money
from
the
federal
government

The
company
has
a
deadline
set
at

If
it
does

do
so
by
then

it

bankruptcy
protection

``
We
're
focusing
very
much
on
the
cost
side

the
business

once
you
start
losing
revenues
you
get
into

circle

chance

a
GM
bankruptcy

While
the
GM	ORGANIZATION
equity
today
is
largely
uninvestable
,
we
increasingly
believe
GM
may
emerge
substantially
stronger
from
a
bankruptcy

provided
the
Chapter
11
process

sell
less
than
a
hundred
automobiles

``
We
recognize
in

short
term
we
will
see
some
loss
of
sales
.

But
based
on
the
long
term
...
the
dealer
network

is
key

it

U.S.	GPE

GM	ORGANIZATION
plans
to
close
1,1
dealerships

American	GPE
automobile
manufacturer

shut
down

an
effort

evade
bankruptcy

lower
its

GM

move
comes

Chrysler	PERSON

another
U.S.	GPE
car
maker

released
a
list

closing

not
publicly
announce

shut
down

franchises
wo
n't
be
renewed
after
October
of
next

will
receive
a
private
letter
telling
them
of
the
decision
.

At
the
moment
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
has
6,246
dealers
in
the
U.S.	GPE
.

It
intends
to
reduce
that
number
to
3,605
by
the
end
of
2010
.

GM
said
the
dealerships
that
were
to
be
closed
are
``
underperforming
and
very
small
sales
volume
U.S.	GPE
dealers
.
``

``
They
're
dealerships
that
are
in
most
cases
hurting
,
losing
money
,
and
in
danger
of
going
out
of
business
anyway
,
``
said
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
sales
,
service
,
and
marketing
vice
president
in
a
telephone
conference
.

``
It
's
a
move
that
people
could
argue
should
have
been
taken
years
ago
but
this
leadership
team
had
no
choice
but
to
do
it
today
.
``

The
dealers
that
are
to
be
closed
represent
18
%
of
the
firm
's
dealership
network

only
7

Barack	PERSON
Obama	ORGANIZATION
presents
rescue
plan
after
GM	ORGANIZATION
declaration
of
bankruptcy

June
1
,
2009

In
a
televised
speech
from
the
White House	FACILITY
at
16:00
UTC
today
,
President
of
the
United States	GPE
Barack Obama	PERSON
presented
a
reorganization
plan
following
the
12:00
UTC
announcement
by
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
that
it
had
filed
for
bankruptcy
and
Chapter
11
protection
from
its
creditors
,
the
largest
bankruptcy
of
a
U.S.	GPE
manufacturing
company
.

Describing
the
problem
with
the
company
as
one
that
had
been
``
decades
in
the
making
,
``
Obama	PERSON
explained
the
rationale
behind
his
proposed
reorganization
plan
for
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
.

He
stated
that
his
intent
was
not
to
``
perpetuate
]
the
bad
business
decisions
of
the
past
,
``
and
that
loaning
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
money
,
when
debt
was
its
problem
,
would
have
been
doing
exactly
that
.

His
plan
,
he
stated
,
was
for
the
United States	GPE
government
,
in
conjunction
with
the
governments
of
Canada	GPE
and
Ontario	GPE
(
which
he
thanked
for
their
roles
alongside
the
government
of
Germany	GPE
which
he
thanked
for
its
role
in
selling
a
corporate
stake
in
GM Europe	ORGANIZATION
)
,
to
become
shareholders
in
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
.

The
United States	GPE
government
would
hold
a
60
%
stake
.

The
government
will
give
GM
a
capital
infusion
of
US	GPE
$
30
billion
in
addition
to
the
funds
it
has
already
received
.

Of
the
government
ownership
he
stated
that
he
refused
``
to
let
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
and
Chrysler	PERSON
become
wards
of
the
state
``
,
and
described
the
bankruptcy
of
Chrysler	GPE
,
and
the
bankruptcy
of
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
that
he
envisioned
as
being
``
quick
,
surgical
,
bankruptcies
``
.

He
pointed
to
the
bankruptcy
of
Chrysler	PERSON
as
an
example
of
what
he
envision
for
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
,
but
stated
that
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
was
a
``
more
complex
company
``
than
Chrysler	PERSON
.

Responding
to
challenges
voiced
by
political
opponents
,
before
the
speech
,
that
the
federal
government
would
actively
participate
in
the
affairs
of
the
restructured
company
,
he
stated
that
he
had
``
no
interest
``
in
running
GM	ORGANIZATION
,
and
that
the
federal
government
would
``
refrain
from
exercising
its
rights
``
as
a
corporate
shareholder
for
the
most
part
.

In
particular
,
he
stated
that
the
federal
government
would
not
exercise
its
rights
as
a
shareholder
to
dictate
``
what
new
type
of
car
to
make
.
``

He
stated
that
he
expected
the
restructured
GM
to
make
``
high
quality
,
safe
,
and
fuel-efficient
cars
of
tomorrow
,
``
and
several
times
described
what
he
anticipated
as
``
better
``
and
``
fuel-efficient
``
cars
,
after
a
streamlining
of
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
brands
.

He
said
to
the
general
public
that
``
I
will
not
pretend
that
the
hard
times
are
over
.
``

He
described
the
financial
hardship
that
some
--
shareholders
,
communities
based
around
GM	ORGANIZATION
plants
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
dealers
,
and
others
--
would
undergo
as
a
``
sacrifice
for
the
next
generation
``
on
their
parts
,
so
that
their
children
could
live
in
``
an
America	GPE
that
still
makes
things
,
``
concluding
that
one
day
the
United States	GPE
might
return
to
a
time
when
the
maxim
(
a
widely-repeated
mis-quotation
of
what
Charles Erwin Wilson	PERSON
once
testified
before
the
U.S.	GPE
Senate
when
nominated
for
the
position
of
Secretary
of
Defense	GPE
)
would
once
more
be
true
that
``
what
is
good
for
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
is
good
for
the

CEO
of
GM	ORGANIZATION
outlines
plan
for
``
New	GPE
GM
``
after
auto
company
declared
bankruptcy

June
4
,
2009

In
a
New York	GPE
press
conference
at
16:15
UTC
,
June
1st
,
Fritz Henderson	PERSON
,
the
Chief
Executive
Officer
of
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
,
which
filed
for
bankruptcy
and
Chapter
11
protection
from
its
creditors
earlier
today
,
outlined
a
plan
for
what
he
called
a
``
New	GPE
GM
``
.

Speaking
to
the
press
under
safe
harbor
provisions
of
U.S.	GPE
law
,
Henderson	PERSON
described
the
events
of
today
as
a
``
defining
moment
``
in
the
history
of
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
.

Speaking
to
the
public
he
said
that
``
The
GM
that
let
you
down
is
history
,
``
and
described
a
``
New	GPE
GM
``
that
he
expected
to
result
from
the
bankruptcy
process
.

Henderson	PERSON
stated
that
he
envisioned
the
bankruptcy
process
would
take
between
60
and
90
days
.

He
stressed
several
times
his
view
that
the
process
would
be
one
that
is
executed
quickly
,
saying
that
not
just
a
sense
of
urgency
but
``
pure
unadulterated
speed
``
was
his
expectation
of
the
process
.

He
emphasized
that
``
GM
remains
open
for
business
``
during
the
bankruptcy
period
,
continuing
to
sell
and
to
support
its
products
,
and
that
day
one
motions
had
been
filed
in
the
bankruptcy
court
in
order
to
allow
this
.

Regarding
the
bankruptcy
process
he
said
,
``
We
will
do
it
right
.

And
we
will
do
it
once
.
``

He
stated
that
the
plan
for
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
had
the
support
of
the
United Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
,
the
Canadian	GPE
Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
,
the
GM	ORGANIZATION
VEBA
,
and
a
majority
of
the
unsecured
bondholders
of
GM	ORGANIZATION
.

He
also
mentioned
that
GM	ORGANIZATION
had
already
received
$
1.5
million
in
bridge
financing
from
the
German	GPE
government
.

In
response
to
questions
about
the
possibility
of
the
United States	GPE
federal
government
,
a
majority
shareholder
in
the
restructured
company
,
dictating
future
product
development
and
strategy
,
such
as
the
sale
of
more
fuel-efficient
and
green
vehicles
``
;
''
he
first
observed
that
the
federal
government
had
already
stated
to
him
that
it
had
``
no
real
interest
in
running
our
business
``
and
that
he
expected
that
still
to
be
his
job
.

Of
the
specific
hypothetical
scenario
where
the
management
of
GM	ORGANIZATION
wants
to
make
one
type
of
car
,
because
it
thinks
that
it
is
the
right
thing
for
the
business
,
and
the
U.S.	GPE
government
wants
to
make
another
type
of
car
,
he
stated
that
``
I
do
n't
think
it
's
going
to
happen
.
``

Expanding
on
that
point
he
stated
that
he
expected
the
``
New	GPE
GM
``
to
focus
upon
``
highly
fuel-efficient
and
green
technology
``
,
and
that
operating
both
in
accordance
with
U.S.	GPE
environmental
laws
and
in
response
to
customer
demand
would
naturally
result
in
the
New	ORGANIZATION
GM
producing
the
types
of
vehicles
that
the
U.S.	GPE
government
would
encourage
.

The
``
New	GPE
GM
``
he
also
expected
to
focus
on
``
four
core
brands
``
,
and
will
size
its
dealership
to
match
that
.

He
stated
that
GM	ORGANIZATION
would
offer
a
``
deferred
termination
``
package
to
dealers
,
to
allow
them
to
cease
dealing
in
GM
vehicles
in
a
managed
and
gradual
way
.

He
stated
that
the
bankruptcy
filings
did
not
cover
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
'
businesses
in
Latin America	GPE
,
Europe	GPE
and
the
Middle East	GPE
,
and
Asia	GPE
and
the
Pacific	ORGANIZATION
.

Of
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
profitable
ventures
in
China	GPE
,
specifically
,
he
stated
that
they
were
``
a
critical
part
of
the
New	ORGANIZATION
GM
``
.

In
response
to
questions
of
whether
the
New	ORGANIZATION
GM
would
import
cars
from
China	GPE
to
the
U.S.	GPE
,
he
stated
the
formative
company
's
core
principle
that
``
We
build
where
we
sell
``
applied
in
both
directions
,
with
GM	ORGANIZATION
building
in
China	GPE
to
sell
in
China	GPE
and
building
in
the
U.S.	GPE
to
sell
in
the
U.S.	GPE
,
stating
that
this
shortened
supply
chains
.

He
declined
to
predict
when
the
New	ORGANIZATION
GM
would
return
to
profitability
,
stating
that
the
goal
was
rather
to
lower
the
break-even
EBIT	ORGANIZATION
point
for
the
company
.

He
also
declined
to
speculate
upon
when
the
U.S.	GPE
government
would
sell
its
stake
in
the
company
,
saying
that
that
was
a
question
``
better
addressed
to
the
U.S.	GPE
Treasury
``
,
and
merely
saying
that
he
expected
it
to
be
``
years
,
not
months
``
when
the
U.S.	GPE
Treasury	ORGANIZATION
felt
it
would
give
``
the
right
return
for
taxpayers
.

According

future
Saturn
vehicles
will
be
fuel
economy

Automobile
manufacturer
Ford
posts
unexpected
profits

November
3
,
2009

The
US	GSP
automobile
manufacturer
Ford	ORGANIZATION
has
said
that
it
posted
a
net
profit
of
US	GPE
$
997
million
in
the
third
quarter
of
this
year
,
and
predicted
that
it
would
be
``
solidly
profitable
``
by
2011
.

The
reports
surprised
most
analysts
,
who
had
forecast
that
the
auto
company
would
lose
money
.

Ford	GPE
's
profits
equate
to
26
cents
per
share
,
a
large
difference
to
the
12
cent
per
share
lost
that
had
been
anticipated
by
most
economic
analysts
.

``
Our
third-quarter
results
clearly
show
Ford	ORGANIZATION
is
making
tremendous
progress
despite
the
prolonged
economic
slump
,
``
said
the
firm

chief
executive
officer

Alan Mulally	PERSON

``
While
we
still
face
a
challenging
road
ahead
,
our
transformation
is
working

our

grow
stronger
.
``

Mulally
predicted
that
his
company
would
meet
or
even
surpass
all
of
its
financial
targets
,
and
suggested
that
the
fourth

of
this

could
see
it
post
an

November

The
US	GSP
car
manufacturer
General	ORGANIZATION
Motors	PERSON
said
that
it
would
axe
10
jobs
at
its
European	GPE
division
,
Opel	PERSON
.

According
to
the
company
's
vice
president
John Smith	PERSON
,
the
firm
wanted
to
reduce
costs
at
Opel	ORGANIZATION
by
30
%
.

Smith	PERSON
announced
the
company
's
move
on
Wednesday
.

He
did
n't
say
where
the
cuts
were
going
to
take
place
,
but
wanted
to
present
details
of
the
plan
to
European	GPE
governments
``
very
soon

A
day
before
the
announcement
,

said
it
was
cancelling
a
deal
to
sell
Opel	PERSON
to
Magna	GPE
,
a
Canadian	GPE
automobile
parts
company

Politicians
in

expressed
disappointment
at
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
cancellation
of
the
Magna	ORGANIZATION
deal
,
which
the
country
's

had
favoured
.

``
GM

behaviour
towards

completely
unacceptable

said
German	GPE
economy
minister
Rainer Bruederle	PERSON

The
premier

remarked
that

The

welcomed

Ford
Motors
posts
US	ORGANIZATION
$
2.7
billion
annual
profit

January
28
,
2010

Ford
Motors
Co.
,
the
automobile
manufacturing
firm
,
has
posted
an
annual
profit
for
the
last
year
of
US	GPE
$
2.7
billion
,
the
first
gain
for
four
years
.

The
statistics
are
an
improvement
from
2008
,
when
the
car
company
posted
a
loss
of
close
to
$
15
billion
.

For
the
final
quarter
of
2009
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
says
it
made
profits
of
$
868
million
,
and
expects
to
continue
to
be
profitable
this
year
.

The
company
had
cut
its
costs
to
$
118.3
billion
last
year
,
$
19.8
billion
than
the
year
previous
.

Ford
had
a
$
34.3
billion
debt
at
the
end
of
2009
.

In
the
fourth
quarter
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
brand
sales
were
up
thirteen
percent
compared
to
the
same
time
in
2008
in
the
US	GSP
,
and
obtained
15.3
%
of
the
automobile
market
in
the
country
.

The
firm
's
president
and
chief
executive
,
Alan Mulally	PERSON
,
commented
on
the
profits
.

``
While
we
still
face
significant
challenges
ahead
,
2009
was
a
pivotal
year
for
Ford	ORGANIZATION
and
the
strongest
proof
yet
that
our
One
Ford
plan
is
working
and
that
we
are
forging
a
path
toward
profitable
growth

he
said

adding
that
``
global
economic
conditions
are
reviving

Ford	GPE
's
US	ORGANIZATION
auto
sales
spike
,
surpassing
GM

March
3
,
2010

Ford
Motor
Company
said
on
Tuesday
that
its
sales
in
the
United States	GPE
rose
43
%
in
February
compared
to
the
same
period
last
year
,
as
the
automaker
outsold
rivals
Toyota	PERSON
and
General Motors	ORGANIZATION
.

Ford	PERSON
said
that
total
sales
improved
to
142,285
units
,
compared
to
141,951
units
sold
by
GM	ORGANIZATION
.

Additionally
,
Ford	PERSON
said
that
its
share
of
the
total
US	GSP
car
market
rose
to
17
%
,
up
from
14
%
a
year
ago
.

The
increase
was
better
than
analysts
had
predicted
,
and
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
stock
rose
to
a
five-year
high
in
morning
trading
,
before
declining
later
in
the
day
.

Ford	GPE
's
sales
were
significantly
influenced
by
a
74
%
increase
in
fleet
sales
to
businesses
.

Rental	GPE
car
agencies
alone
accounted
for
around
30
units
sold
.

Sales
to
retail
consumers
increased
only
28
%
.

The
increases
were
led
by
sales
of
two
sedans
,
the
Fusion	ORGANIZATION
and
Taurus	GPE
,
which
rose
166.5
and
93.3
%
respectively
,
although
sales
of
other
models
such
as
SUVs	ORGANIZATION
and
pickup
trucks
also
increased
.

Both
models
were
significantly
redesigned
last
year
,
and
analysts
said
that
improved
quality
from
such
cars
were
driving
the
increases
.

Other
companies
also
reported
February
sales
today
,
nearly
all
reporting
sales
gains
as
well
,
although
none
as
large
as
those
of
Ford
.

Toyota	PERSON
was
the
sole
exception
to
the
sales
gains
,
as
their
sales
declined
8.7
%
,
as
the
company
was
faced
with
a
global
recall
during
the
month
that
led
to
a
temporary
stoppage
of
production
for
some
models
.

``
The
strength
of
our
new
products
...
are
resonating
with
customers
,
``
said
Ken Czubay	PERSON
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
vice
president
of
sales
and
marketing
.

However
,
he
believed
that
traditional
Toyota
customers
were
not
buying
rival
autos
,
but
rather
awaiting
the
results
from
the
recalls
.

Fiat	GPE
plans
to
buy
majority
stake
in
Chrysler	GPE

May
29
,
2011

Fiat	PERSON
announced
on
Friday
that
it
intends
to
purchase
the
six
percent
of
automaker
Chrysler	PERSON
that
the
US	GPE
government
currently
owns
,
which
would
give
the
Italian	GPE
company
a
52
percent
majority
stake
in
Chrysler	GPE
.

According
to
Fiat	PERSON
's
announcement
,
the
company
has
told
the
US Treasury	ORGANIZATION
that
it
intends
to
use
its
option
to
buy
the
share
in
Chrysler	GPE
held
by
the
US	GPE
government
,
a
deal
that
will
be
finalized
by
June
10
.

If
a
price
is
not
agreed
on
by
that
time
,
Fiat	PERSON
will
pay
the
average
of
the
estimates
of
two
investment
banks
.

In
2009
,
Fiat	PERSON
bought
a
twenty
percent
stake
in
Chrysler	GPE
,
which
had
just
exited
bankruptcy
,
and
has
since
increased
its
holding
to
46
percent
,
expected
to
increase
to
57
%
by
the
end
of
this
year
.

According
to
analyst
Maryann Keller	PERSON
,
the
deal
is
a
good
one
for
both
companies
,
as
``
n
]
either
one
has
the
ability
to
compete
alone
in
the
kind
of
global
environment
that
they
face
.
``

Analyst	PERSON
Rebecca Lindland	PERSON
said
that
the
move
will

Ford
Motor
Company
cutting
30
jobs
by
2012

January
23
,
2006

The
Ford Motor Company	ORGANIZATION
,
the
second-largest
car
manufacturer
in
America	GPE
,
will
cut
30
jobs
and
14
plants
as
part
of
a
restructuring
plan
to
relieve
Ford
after
a
US
$
1.6
billion
loss
last
year
in
North	GPE
American	GPE
sales
.

The
plan
,
called
``
Way
Forward
``
,
the
brainchild
of
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
Chief
Executive
Officer
,
William Clay Ford	PERSON
Jr.
,
is
to
end
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
North	LOCATION
American	GPE
losses
by
2008
.

To
accomplish
this
30
jobs
which
make
up
20
to
25
percent
of
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
North	LOCATION
American	GPE
workforce
of
122
people
will
be
cut
and
14
plants
will
be
closed
in
order
to
bring
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
production
capacity
in
line
with
demand
.

By
the
end
of
this
year
,
the
Atlanta	ORGANIZATION
and
St.	GPE
Louis
plants
will
be
closed
.

Atlanta	GPE
makes
the
Ford Taurus	ORGANIZATION
sedan
,
which
is
being
phased
out
.

The
St. Louis	ORGANIZATION
plant
is
one
of
two
plants
that
manufactures
the
Ford Explorer	ORGANIZATION
,
whose
sales
had
a
29
%
decline
in
2005
.

It
will
also
close
its
Wixom
,
Michigan	PERSON
plant
,
Batavia Transmission	PERSON
in
Ohio	GPE
the
Windsor	ORGANIZATION
Casting
plant
in
Ontario	GPE
which
was
previously
announced
by
Ford
that
it
was
to
be
closed
after
contract
negotiations
with
the
Canadian	GPE
Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
.

The
plant
in
St. Thomas	GPE
,
Ontario	GPE
plant
will
have
one
shift
cut
from
it
.

The
plant
makes
the
Crown Victoria	FACILITY
and
Grand Marquis	PERSON
cars
.

On
this
cut
of
the
one
shift
,
Whitey MacDonald	PERSON
,
chairperson
of
Local 1520	ORGANIZATION
,
Canadian	GPE
Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
said
``
There
is
a
lot
of
anger
here
today
,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
.

Any
time
a
plant
goes
to
one
shift
,
it
puts
them
in
limbo
.

This
car
has
made
the
company
millions
of
dollars
over
the
years
they
have
invested
in
other
products
and
locations
-
we
are
entitled
to
some
new
investment
given
our
track
record
.
``

Positive
news
for
the
plant
is
that
Ford	ORGANIZATION
is
still
committed
to
invest
$
200
million
into
the
plant
to
upgrade
the
appearance
of
the
two
cars
manufactured
there
.

On
the
contrary
,
according
to
Automotive	GPE
analyst
Dennis	PERSON
DesRosier
believes
that
the
factory
is
still
``
likely
``
to
close
.

DesRoiser
said
,
``
The
St. Thomas	ORGANIZATION
plant
is
old
,
the
product
is
old
,
it
make
sense
it
is
on
that
list
.

This
may
be
just
a
short-term
reprieve
,
it
may
be
look
at
permanent
closure
in
two
to
three
years
.
``

Two
more
plants
will
close
in
2008
,
another
two
in
2012
.

Two
more
plants
to
be
closed
are
to
be
announced
later
this
year
.

Also
,
Ford	ORGANIZATION
will
fire
12
%
of
its
53
executive
officers
.

Due
to
the
company
's
current
contract
with
the
United Auto Workers	ORGANIZATION
union
,
workers
at
the
idled
plants
will
still
be
receiving
their
pay
and
benefits
until
Ford	ORGANIZATION
negotiates
a
new
contract
with
the
union
.

However
,
the
workers
may
not
earn
what
they
earn
today
because
they
will
not
be
eligible
for
overtime
.

The
UAW	ORGANIZATION
President
Ron Gettelfinger	PERSON
and
Vice
President
Gerald Bantom	PERSON
called
say
the
plan
is
``
extremely
disappointing
.
``

The
UAW	ORGANIZATION
issued
statement
saying
``
The
impacted
hourly
and
salaried
workers
find
themselves
facing
uncertain
futures
because
of
senior
management
's
failure
to
halt
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
sliding
market
share
.

The
announcement
has
further
left
a
cloud
hanging
over
the
entire
work
force
because
of
pending
future
announcements
of
additional
facilities
to
be
closed
at

GM
posts
first
annual
loss
since
1992

January

(ORGANIZATIO

Motors
logo
.

General Motors Corporation	ORGANIZATION
(
GM
)
has
posted
its
first
annual
loss
since
1992
.

GM	ORGANIZATION
reported
losing
US	ORGANIZATION
$
4.8
billion
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
2005
and
a
total
loss
of
$
8.6
billion
for
the
entire
year
.

GM
admitted
Thursday
night
that
the
loss
could
swell
further
as
it
pays
pensions
and
healthcare
costs
to
thousands
of
former
workers
.

GM
warned
that
the
amount
calculated
for
last
year
is
preliminary
and
could
rise
before
it
is
officially
reported
to
the
US	ORGANIZATION
securities
and
exchanges
commission
in
March
.

The
loss
was
far
greater
than
analysts
predicted
.

Ford	GPE
,
the
second
of
the
big
three
American	GPE
car
manufacturers
,
beat
predictions
earlier
in
the
week
.

In
contrast
,
Toyota	PERSON
is
expected
to
report
that
it
will
beat
last
year
's
profit
of
$
11
billion
.

GM
's
automotive
division
lost
$
1.5
billion
in
the
fourth
quarter
,
driven
by
losses
in
North America	GPE
.

This
has
been
attributed
to
GM	ORGANIZATION
's
shrinking
market
share
,
which
has
been
taken
by
Japanese	GPE
manufacturers
Toyota	PERSON
and
Nissan	GPE
.

A
further
$
1.3
billion
was
lost
in
restructuring
charges
.

As
part
of
the
restructure
,
GM	ORGANIZATION
plans
to
cut
30
jobs
and
close
12
facilities
by
2008
.

An
aide
for
Kirk Kerkorian	PERSON
,
GMs	ORGANIZATION
largest
individual
investor
(
at
9.9
%
)
,
has
called
on
the
company
to
halve
its

annual
dividend
,
cut
executive
pay
and
sell

Australian	GPE
government
announces
$
52.5
million
financial
assistance
package
for
Ford	ORGANIZATION

May
5
,
2006

Australian	GPE
Prime
Minister
John Howard	PERSON
and
federal
industry
minister
Ian MacDonald	PERSON
today
announced
that
the
federal
government
would
be
providing
Ford Australia	ORGANIZATION
with
a
AU
$
52.5
million
(
US	ORGANIZATION
$
40.4
million
)
``
financial
assistance
package
``
.

Additional
assistance
will
also
be
provided
by
the
Victorian	GPE
state
government
.

According
to
Mr
Howard	PERSON
,
the
injection
will
secure
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
manufacturing
operations
in
Australia	GPE
``
for
the
long
term
``
.

From
the
package
,
AU
$
40
million
will
be
used
for
the
design
and
manufacture
of
Ford	ORGANIZATION
's
next
model
Falcon	PERSON
and
Territory	ORGANIZATION
vehicles
,
which
will
be
built
in
Australia	GPE
.

Despite
being
given
a
major
facelift
in
2002
and
another
in
2005
,
the
Falcon	ORGANIZATION
's
bodyshell
dates
back
to
1998
.

The
current
Falcon	PERSON
will
need
to
serve
the
company
until
at
least
2007
when
the
new
model
is
anticipated
.

In
the
meantime
,
it
will
face
stiff
competition
from
the
completely
new
Holden Commodore	PERSON
(
the
Falcon	ORGANIZATION
's
major
competitor
)
which
will
be
released
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
.

The
additional
AU
$
12.5
million
will
be
spent
on
the
development
of
a
light
commercial
vehicle
platform
,
which
will
be
built
overseas
and
marketed
to
around
80
countries
.

Mr
Howard	PERSON
said
that
the
light
commercial
project
would
involve
construction
of
a
research
and
development
centre
,
which
will
become
the
base
for
R
&
D
projects
in
the
region
.

Mr
MacFarlane	ORGANIZATION
said
that
the
research
facility
was
exciting
for
Australia	GPE
and
that
it
would
put
the
Australian	GPE
automotive
in
the
spotlight
.

``
The
funding
has
helped
Ford Australia	ORGANIZATION
secure
the
largest
automotive
R
&
D
project
ever
undertaken
in
Australia	GPE
which
is
equally
exciting
news
for
local
Ford
employees
and
Australian	GPE
component
producers
``
he
said
.

``
The
project
will
see
Ford Australia	ORGANIZATION
become
a
centre
for
automotive
design
and
engineering
excellence
in
the
Asia	GPE
Pacific
region
which
will
bring
spin-off
benefits
for
the
broader
industry
,
``
``
This
opportunity
will
put
both
Ford
Australia	GPE
,
and
the
Australian	GPE
automotive
and
components
sectors
on
the
world
map
as
far
as
our
automotive
design
and
engineering
capabilities
are
concerned
.
``

Mr
(ORGANIZATIO
MacFarlane
said
.

Mr
Howard	PERSON
claims
that
the
projects
will
create
273
jobs
and
secure
the
future
of
the
``
iconic
``
Ford
Falcon
,
which
has
been
built
in
Australia	GPE
since
1960
.

The
financial
package
is
conditional
upon
Ford	ORGANIZATION
Australia
giving
the
Australian	GPE
automotive
component
industry
an
opportunity
to
supply
components
for
the
vehicles
produced
by
the
two
projects
.

Ford
announces
deep
production
cuts
in
response
to
growing
losses

August
19
,
2006

Ford	GSP
has
announced
sweeping
cuts
of
21
%
(
168
units
)
in
its
US	ORGANIZATION
and
Canadian	GPE
production
,
resulting
in
the
partial
closure
of
ten
of
its
plants
during
the
fourth
quarter
.

The
measure
comes
on
top
of
existing
turnaround
plans
announced
in
January
,
in
which
25
to
30
positions
should
be
cut
and
14
plants
closed
by
2012
.

Ford
is
the
world
's
third-largest
automaker
and
the
U.S.	GPE
's
second-largest
.

However
it
has
in
recent
years
been
struggling
with
poor
profitability
and
shrinking
market
shares
.

In
2005
it
lost
$
1.6
billion
and
recently
the
company
reported
a
second
quarter
loss
of
$
254
million
and
a
34
%
year-year
decline
in
sales
for
the
month
of
July
.

George	PERSON
Pipas	GPE
,
director
of
sales
analysis
at
Ford	ORGANIZATION
,
points
to
rising
gas
prices
having
negative
impact
on
the
sale
of
the
companies
SUV	ORGANIZATION
lines
as
well
as
its
sales
leader
,
the
F-series
pickup
truck
as
being
the
direct
cause
of
the
latest
initiative
.

So
far
the
following

are
thought
to
be
affected
:

Ford
Taurus
to
be
revived

February
9
,
2007

thumb
Ford
Motor
Company
CEO
Alan Mulally	PERSON
has
reported
that
Ford	ORGANIZATION
will
rename
the
Ford Five Hundred	ORGANIZATION
to
the
Taurus	GPE
for
the
2008
model
year
,
when
a
facelifted
model
is
expected
to
be
launched
to
improve
the
lackluster
sales
of
the
outgoing
model
.

Mulally	GPE
says
that
Ford	PERSON
's
decision
to
name
all
their
cars
with
the
letter
F
was
a
lackluster
move
,
and
makes
their
names
easily
forgettable
.

As
a
result
,
Mulally	PERSON
plans
on
reviving
many
respected
Ford	ORGANIZATION
nameplates
,
the
Taurus	ORGANIZATION
being
one
of
them
,
and
the
Falcon	ORGANIZATION
possibly
in
the
future
.

The
Ford Taurus	ORGANIZATION
was
originally
introduced
in
1986
,
and
was
a
revolutionary
car
that
rewrote
the
rules
for
creating
a
sedan
,
and
pushed
the
other
American	GPE
automakers
to
follow
suit
,
leading
to
a
design
revolution
that
completely
rid
Detroit
of
the
``
boxy
``
cars
of
the
70s
and
80s
.

The
Taurus	ORGANIZATION
survived
for
four
generations
,
selling
over
7,500,000
units
.

The
Taurus	GPE
was
discontinued
in
October
2006
,
after
a
brief
run
of
2007
models
destined
for
fleet
customers
.

``
How
can
it
go
away
?
``

Alan	PERSON
Mulally	PERSON
remembered
asking
,
``
It
's
the
best-selling
car
in
America	GPE
.
``

While
it
is
not
expected
for
the
name
change
to
turn
the
Five Hundred	FACILITY
into
a
400
plus
units
a
year
blockbuster
like
the
Taurus	GPE
,
it
is
expected
to
make
sales
more
solid
,
and
to
make
the
car
well
known
,
since
the
Taurus	GPE
is
a
well
known
nameplate
around
the
country
.
